IDEAS



planets
* waterplanet with gravity dependent waves (like in the movie interstellar)

* weather simulation/interaction

* geology simulation???

* teraforming (see for an example "universe sandbox 2")

* procedural craters

* simulation of gas content of a planet depending on gravity and stelar wind from the host star
	TODO link to astronomy stack overflow

* rogue planets

* magnetic fields for sun -> corana ejection path
* magnetic field for planets -> aura "path"

* commet effect for planets/asteroids
   * for objects near a star
   * for comets

* pulsar with pulsar beam

* iron planet (if hot -> iron athmosphere

* diamond "planets" (cooled down stellar core)



“globular cluster” (with star dynamics simulated with RK4)

tektites,


gas dwarf
