# WhiteSphere-Engine

What is that?
---

This is a space "game"-engine with a focus on

 * realism
 * AI

Why write jet another engine?
---

Because I couldn't find any engine which has built in double precision for the gameworld and physics and AI, built in support for extremly large gameworlds, etc. Another point is the licence.

What is the end vision of this engine and an 'game' with this engine?
---

ARMA and dwarft fortress in Space.

Can I fork it?
---

Yes.
